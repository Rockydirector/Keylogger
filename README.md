# 🔑 Keylogger Tool with Encrypted Data Exfiltration (PoC)

## Overview
This is a **proof-of-concept keylogger tool** designed for **educational and authorized security research**.  
It captures keystrokes, encrypts the collected data, stores logs locally, and simulates exfiltration to a server.  
The main goal of this tool is to demonstrate **potential attack techniques** and help defenders understand **endpoint security risks**.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This tool is strictly for **learning, lab experiments, and authorized testing**.  
> Running it on machines without explicit written permission is **illegal**.

## Features
- Real-time keystroke capture using a Python-based listener.  
- Encryption of logs using secure symmetric cryptography.  
- Local storage of encrypted logs with timestamps.  
- Simulated exfiltration to a remote or local server.  
- Built-in **kill switch** for safe termination of the tool.  
- Optional demonstration of startup persistence for educational purposes.

---

## Objectives
- Understand how keyloggers operate and the potential risks they pose.  
- Demonstrate the importance of **encryption and secure data handling**.  
- Simulate exfiltration in a controlled, safe environment.  
- Provide a learning tool for ethical cybersecurity education.

---

## Ethical Considerations
- This tool must only be used in **controlled lab environments** or on devices you **own or have explicit permission** to test.  
- Avoid capturing sensitive personal data or credentials.  
- Always clean up and securely remove logs after testing.  
- Study this tool to understand **defensive techniques**, such as endpoint monitoring and intrusion detection.

## Conclusion
This keylogger PoC illustrates how an attacker could **capture, encrypt, and exfiltrate keystrokes**.  
By understanding its operation, security professionals can improve **defensive strategies** to detect and prevent similar attacks.  
It serves as a learning tool to enhance knowledge in **ethical hacking, cybersecurity awareness, and endpoint security**.
